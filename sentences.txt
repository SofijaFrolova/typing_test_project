A sudden warm rainstorm washes down in sweet hyphens.
The sky, at sunset, looked like a carnivorous flower.
Inside us there is something that has no name, that something is what we are.
Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real.
In the deep gloom he could see the electric white gashes where the water boiled over the boulders.
There are some things that are so unforgivable that they make other things easily forgivable.
Memory is a great deceiver, grief and longing cloud the past, and recollections, even vivid ones, fade.
We are souls shut inside a cage of bones; souls squeezed into a parcel of flesh.
Beauty is an enormous, unmerited gift given randomly, stupidly.
And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.
Tomorrow is always fresh, with no mistakes in it yet.
